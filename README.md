# PPTP-VPN

PPTP VPN Installer Script

A Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) allows you to implement your own VPN very quickly, and is compatible with most mobile devices. Even though PPTP is less secure than OpenVPN, it is also faster and uses less CPU resources.

Tested on Centos 7.0 (VPS)

# Install

Copy script by using ` git clone wget https://github.com/Sajibekanti/PPTP-VPN.git `

Run using  ` ./install.sh `

Script will ask for username and password for VPN, set them correctly

Connect the VPN and Enjoy :)
